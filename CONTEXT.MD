🛡️ SaferSteps — Context
🧭 Overview
Every day, millions of people make decisions about where to walk, live, study, or park — but information about personal safety is fragmented, outdated, or hidden behind bureaucratic systems.
SaferSteps is a web and mobile platform that brings transparency to urban safety.
By combining official data (sex offender registries, open police reports, lighting datasets) with community insights and AI-generated summaries, SaferSteps gives users a personalized, easy-to-understand picture of how safe any location, street, or route is — all in real time.
💡 Problem
Today, safety data exists — but it’s scattered and inaccessible:
Government sites list offenders, but without any spatial context or explanations.
Police data portals are raw, hard to interpret, and non-actionable.
Maps show streets but not how they feel or how well they’re lit.
Vulnerable populations (students, women, night-shift workers, travelers) are left to rely on guesswork, social media, or anecdotal warnings.
Meanwhile, social media platforms are filled with reactive safety stories — not proactive intelligence.
We asked:
“What if anyone could instantly see and understand how safe a place truly is — with data and empathy combined?”
🌍 Our Solution
SaferSteps transforms safety from a confusing stream of statistics into clear, actionable insights.
Key Features
🗺️ Safety Heatmap:
Each neighborhood, block, and building receives a Safety Score (0–100) based on combined data sources:
Crime density
Registered offenders
Street lighting coverage
Community reports
💬 AI Safety Summaries:
Clicking any address reveals a concise, human-readable insight generated by our AI layer:
“This block has seen two petty thefts this week and has limited lighting at night. It’s busier and safer during the day.”
🚶‍♀️ Safer Route Planner:
Users can request directions that prioritize safety over speed.
Our algorithm dynamically weights routes to avoid high-risk areas and low-light regions.
🙋 Community Reporting & Verification:
Anyone can submit quick safety observations — “Poor lighting here,” “Frequent catcalling,” “Feels safe now.”
Reports are anonymized, verified through community voting, and layered into the heatmap.
🤖 Real-time Intelligence:
Our backend aggregates open data (e.g. NYC Open Data, state registries) and re-scores areas daily.
AI moderation ensures reports are respectful, factual, and privacy-preserving.
🔬 Technical Architecture
SaferSteps is entirely software-based and deployable on cloud-native infrastructure.
Layer	Technology	Description
Frontend	Next.js (React), Mapbox GL JS, Tailwind CSS	Interactive map, responsive UI, color-coded heatmap
Backend	Node.js (Express) / FastAPI	REST APIs for data fusion, scoring, and routing
Database	Supabase (PostgreSQL)	Stores user reports, safety indices, cached AI summaries
AI Layer	OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo / Mistral	Generates summaries, classifies user reports, filters spam
Data Sources	Government APIs, Open Crime Data, City Lighting Datasets, NSOPW registry	Official data foundation
Routing Engine	Mapbox Directions API + custom safety weighting	Returns optimal safe routes
Hosting	Vercel (frontend), Render / Supabase Edge Functions (backend)	Fully serverless & scalable
🧠 How It Works
1. Data Fusion
Each coordinate tile (~100m grid) aggregates:
crime_density, offender_density, lighting_score, report_weight
These are normalized and combined into a single Safety Index (0–100) using a weighted scoring model.
2. AI Summarization
When a user clicks an area:
The backend gathers all relevant data.
Sends structured JSON to the AI model with a strict prompt template.
Returns a concise paragraph that explains why the score is what it is.
3. Safer Routing
Using Mapbox Directions API, SaferSteps reweights each street segment’s “cost”:
cost = distance * (1 + (1 - safety_index) / 2)
Then it runs Dijkstra/A* to find the route minimizing risk-adjusted distance.
4. Community Layer
Reports are stored in reports table with category tags.
LLM moderation ensures no sensitive or identifiable info is included.
Reputation scoring prevents spam or abuse.
🎯 Impact
Empowers individuals: especially students, women, and travelers, to make data-driven safety decisions.
Strengthens community trust: transforms fear into collaboration.
Encourages civic transparency: bridges the gap between citizens and government data.
Prevents harm proactively: not just reactive emergency alerts, but predictive awareness.
“Where safety maps used to be silent, SaferSteps gives every street a voice.”
🔐 Ethics & Privacy
We designed SaferSteps with privacy and transparency first:
No personal data is stored or sold.
User reports are location-hashed and anonymized.
Offender data is sourced from verified, public registries only.
All AI summaries avoid names or identifiers.
Users can request data removal under our “Right to Delete” policy.
Our goal is empowerment, not surveillance.
🧩 Challenges We Overcame
🗺️ Data normalization: Different city datasets have inconsistent coordinate formats and timestamps.
⚖️ Scoring fairness: We tuned weights to avoid stigmatizing low-income neighborhoods.
🧠 LLM summarization balance: We engineered prompts that are factual, not fear-inducing.
🔒 Ethics compliance: Ensuring sensitive datasets (like registries) are handled with care and clarity.
🚀 What’s Next
Expand coverage to 50+ major U.S. cities using open-data APIs.
Integrate campus alert systems and SafeRide programs.
Launch a Safety Pulse API for developers and municipalities.
Add a Predictive Safety Index using time-series ML (forecasting high-risk time windows).
Partner with universities, local governments, and NGOs for data verification.
